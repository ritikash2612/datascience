afternoon by a payment card industry fraud investigative unit and 
federal authorities informing us that select U.S. store locations may 
have been the victims of possible theft of payment card numbers,” the 
company wrote in an email. 
“Investigators are currently reviewing available information,” the 
statement continued. “At this point, no breach has been confirmed but an
 investigation is underway. Goodwills across the country take the data 
of consumers seriously and their community well-being is our number one 
concern. Goodwill Industries International is working with industry 
contacts and the federal authorities on the investigation. We will 
remain appraised of the situation and will work proactively with any 
individual local Goodwill involved taking appropriate actions if a data 
compromise is uncovered.”Goodwill Industries stated they learned of the potential breach on July 18th and is working with federal investigators to determine if the breach is legitimate and if legitimate. how many stores were affected.
